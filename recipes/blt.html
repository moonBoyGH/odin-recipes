    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato (BLT) sandwich is a classic, beloved for its simplicity and vibrant flavors. It's a delightful combination of crispy, smoky bacon, fresh and crisp lettuce, and juicy, ripe tomato slices sandwiched between two slices of toasted bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 slices of bacon</li>
        <li>2 slices of bread (sourdough, whole wheat, white, or any preferred type)</li>
        <li>1 large leaves of lettuce (iceberg or romaine)</li>
        <li>1-2 ripe tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Butter (optional, for toasting the bread)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Bacon:</strong> <br><br>In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until it reaches your desired level of crispiness. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes per side.<br><br>Once done, transfer the cooked bacon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess grease.</li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Bread:</strong><br><br>If desired, lightly butter one side of each slice of bread. <br><br>This step is optional and can add a nice crunch when toasting the bread.</li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Toast the Bread(Optional):</strong></li><br>Place the bread slices (buttered side down, if using) on a clean skillet or grill pan over medium heat.<br><br>Toast until they reach your preferred level of golden brown and crispiness.<br><br>This step is entirely optional; some prefer their bread untoasted for a softer texture.</li><br><br><br>
        <li><strong>Assemble the BLT:</strong><br><br>Lay the bread slices on a clean surface. If desired, spread a layer of mayonnaise on one or both sides of the bread.<br><br>On one slice of bread, place the lettuce leaves. This creates a bed for the rest of the ingredients and prevents the bread from becoming soggy.<br><br>On top of the lettuce, add the cooked bacon slices. Typically, 2-4 slices are used per sandwich, depending on personal preference.<br><br>Layer the tomato slices on top of the bacon.</li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Complete the Sandwich:</strong><br><br>Place the other slice of bread (with or without mayo, as per preference) on top of the tomatoes, creating a sandwich.</li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Slice and Serve:</strong><br><br>For easier handling, you can slice the sandwich diagonally or straight through the middle.<br><br>Your BLT sandwich is ready to be served and enjoyed!</li><br>
    </ol>
