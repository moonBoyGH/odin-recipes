    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oxtail stew is a hearty and flavorful dish that features tender, succulent meat from the tail of cattle. Slow-cooked to perfection, oxtail is renowned for its rich, gelatinous texture and deep, savory taste. This stew often combines oxtail pieces with an array of vegetables such as carrots, onions, and celery, along with aromatic herbs and spices like thyme, bay leaves, and garlic. The stew is typically simmered for an extended period, allowing the flavors to meld and the meat to become incredibly tender, resulting in a dish that is both comforting and deeply satisfying. Served steaming hot, oxtail stew is a beloved culinary delight, perfect for warming up on chilly days and a testament to the art of slow cooking.</p>

            <br><br>Chop the vegetables - onion, garlic, carrots, and celery.</li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Brown the Oxtails:</strong><br><br> Heat the cooking oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

        <li><strong>Make the Stew:</strong><br><br> Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well to coat.<br><br>Cook for a minute to get rid of the raw flour taste.
            <br><br>Pour in the beef broth and red wine, if using.<br><br>Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits (this adds flavor).
            <br><br>Add the bay leaves, thyme, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li><br><br>
